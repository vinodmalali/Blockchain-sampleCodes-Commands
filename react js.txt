React js
---------

DOM: DOM stands for 'Document Object Model'. In simple terms, it is a structured representation of the HTML elements that are present in a webpage or web-app.

React Hooks are simple JavaScript functions that we can use to isolate the reusable part from a functional component

useEffect : 

The useEffect Hook allows you to perform side effects in your components.

Some examples of side effects are: fetching data, directly updating the DOM, and timers.

useEffect accepts two arguments. The second argument is optional.

useEffect(<function>, <dependency>)

useRef :

The useRef is a hook that allows to directly create a reference to the DOM element in the functional component. 

Syntax:

const refContainer = useRef(initialValue);

useState():

The useState() is a Hook that allows you to have state variables in functional components . so basically useState is the ability to encapsulate local state in a functional component. 
Syntax: The first element is the initial state and the second one is a function that is used for updating the state.

const [state, setState] = useState(initialstate)
